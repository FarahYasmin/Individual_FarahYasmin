I work as a service crew honestly, the job is very difficult for me but over time I became more skilled in doing the job. What I love about working at pizzahut is that my co -workers are very sporty and willing to teach me about the scope of my work. </strong></p>

I feel happy because my ambition to enter the university has been achieved. After registering I have to follow the program that has been set by uitm which is the student destination week or known as MDS. For me, this mds is very tiring but fun because with this MDS I have the opportunity to meet new friends, roommates and classmates. On the last day of mds, I had the opportunity to wear a hijab that had the uitm emblem. At the time, I still couldnâ€™t believe that I had managed to enter the university I had dreamed of since I was in school.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>After the end of MDS then the class begins. I always go to class with my next -door neighbor who I knew when I was at the islamic center on the last day of mds because we were in the same class. I felt so excited to meet my new classmates. When I arrived at the class I managed to greet some of my classmates before the lecturer entered the class. I was studying MDAB at that time and I was in class A. I had a lot of fun entering MDAB because of the various activities we did and I made many friends when I was at UiTM Seri Iskandar. Day after day passed, I have been at uitm for 6 months so we all had to separate to go to the world of diploma. I felt very sad at that point because I had to part with my friends because they would follow their respective paths. </strong></p>
